<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
<H1><bold>Official Rodneys Graphics Opensource Page<bold></H1>
<br>
This is the outlet I have designed on GitHub for my open source projects I'm working on.
Ultimate goal is to create projects to help people in need and hopefully bring down the cost of devices that are currently super expensive in a fairly easy to assemble and configurable design. 
</br>

<h3>Objective #1 </h3>
Create functional Designs that work in the real world for people to use.
<br>
<h3>Objective #2 </h3>
Each Design must be fully Modular and allow for adjustment easly.
<br>
<h3>Objective #3</h3>
All Designs must be easlly made with Laser Cutting, 3D printing and standard items from hardware stores
