<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
<H1>Official Rodneys Graphics Opensource Page </H1>

This is the outlet I have designed on GitHub for my open source projects I'm working on.
Ultimate goal is to create projects to help people in need and hopefully bring down the cost of devices that are currently super expensive in a fairly easy to assemble and configurable design.
